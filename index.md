# Hello World
Welcome to my home page! My name is Riley Labraor, and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/). I'm a Cinema and Television Arts Major and a Computer Science Minor! Take a look at my projects!

### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

Lab 5 Part 1 was increadibly entertaining, focusing on creating a short mad-lib game using arguments on the command line. Learning about command-line argumets was essential for both my overall tool kit and for future labs to come. Futhermore, I have always enjoyed Mad-Lib games even as a kid, so being able to create one through programming was extremely satisfying and fun. 

* Lab 10

Likely the most complex lab we've had, Lab 10 Part 2 had us program a system that allowed a user to search for a county in California and have it pull its population. There were many, many moving parts to a program like this, and I remember me nearly giving up on several occasions. However, seeing all of the parts come together and actually working was so satisfying. This lab focuses on the use of 2D vectors and how to search and pull information in them. It took alot of work to get it to find and pull preciesly what it wanted, but being able to do so taught me how to best conquer a large vector or lab, by breaking it down bit by bit, and line by line, until it all works as intended. 

* Lab 11

Lab 11 Part 2 is a standard Hi Lo game, similar to several other labs where we've done similar games. To me, this one is the epitome of all of them, being the most complex and a clear display of just how much my capabilites has grown just within six months. This one uses Classes to keep track of several game states, which allows for a far cleaner code in the main program. While they were certainly a struggle to learn, I think Classes were one of the most important topics I've learned, and am glad to see it used as the final step in creating a better and better Hi Lo Game.
